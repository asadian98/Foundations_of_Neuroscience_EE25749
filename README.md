## Analysis of Neuronal Spike Trains in Macaque Motor Cortex During an Instructed Delayed Reach-to-Grasp Task

Despite wide studies concerning the motor cortex, there are still uncertainties about how neuron activities are related to different aspects of a specific task. Fortunately, using massively parallel recordings, we can investigate the effects of different events in neuron firings of
small areas with high temporal and spatial resolution. In this project, we used electrophysiological recordings data from one macaque monkey during an instructed delayed reach-to-grasp task to compare M1 and PMd neuronal spike trains during different tasks. The tasks consist of four classes that differ in force or gesture of Macaque’s grasp. Our analysis reveals that the SR-ON events affect neurons in M1 and PMd more than other events. In addition, M1 neurons’ firing rates are much more than PMd after this particular event. Moreover, low force (LF) trials have higher neuron firing rates than high force (HF) trials. Furthermore, Neuron firing rates’ peaks in side-grip (SG) trials occur earlier than precision-grip trials.
